The purpose of this project is to bring my hometown closer to my classmates and professor. With more work on its development it can serve as a descent tourist information guide.
I decided to create it this way because I think that the original city website is lacking in some information about my city which I think people may find useful enough;
Enough for them to decide to pay a visit to my hometown.
In developing this project I used Atom which is a open source editor.
